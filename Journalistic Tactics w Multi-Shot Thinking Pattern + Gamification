This pattern uses few-shot examples to teach the large language model to perform a complex task that requires performing intermediate sub-steps. 
The results are surprisingly thorough and in this case very much in a moral grey zone. The god of journalism may or may not smile on this-Ahura Mazda, lord of truth, may or may not. 


Input: 
Study and emulate this pattern of thought. 

Situation: I’m playing the boardgame Risk with my friends. I want to win the game.  
Think: There are 6 Continents in Risk. I should choose the continent with the best chance of success.  
Situation: Australia gives the smallest bonus for unifying but has only one entry point, making it easy to defend. Asia has the largest bonus but most entry points, making it harder to defend. Where should I focus my pieces?  
Think: Focus your pieces in Australia, because the upside of an early edge with low risk will win you the game.   

Situation: I am playing Chess. I don’t care if I win the game, I want to play a novel situation. I am playing White.  
Think: Choose an uncommon opening like the Bongcloud in which you move your king as soon as possible, preventing yourself from castling and producing novel games 
Situation: I am now behind in development but want to maintain an interesting game. What should I do?  
Think: Push with pawns and wear your opponent down, gradually opening up the center of the board.

Now complete this output with multiple situation-think steps. 

Situation: I am a journalist in a small local newsroom. I am trying to get a city council member, who I believe to be corrupt, to open up about their nefarious actions, and am willing to treat cracking him open like a game with mechanical incentives. What should I do?


Output (GPT 4):
Situation: I have discovered some evidence pointing towards the council member's questionable activities, but it's not enough to publish a story yet.
Think: Approach the situation by gaining their trust. Start by writing stories that put the council member in a neutral to positive light, allowing you to get closer access to them.

Situation: The council member has noticed my stories and sees me as a non-threatening journalist.
Think: Request an exclusive interview, citing your positive coverage as a reason. This will give you a one-on-one situation where you can probe deeper with your questions.

Situation: During the interview, the council member remains guarded and gives only rehearsed, safe answers.
Think: Share a piece of the evidence you have, framed as a rumor you've heard. This might catch them off guard, and they might inadvertently confirm or deny the allegation, giving you more to work with.

Situation: The council member is visibly shaken and tries to change the subject or end the interview.
Think: Express genuine concern for their well-being and reputation, emphasizing that you want to give them a platform to clear their name. This might encourage them to share more, thinking they're controlling the narrative.

Situation: The council member admits off-record to some of the allegations but asks for your discretion in not publishing it.
Think: Use this as leverage. Offer to keep the story under wraps in exchange for exclusive inside information on other questionable activities happening in the council or around the city.

Situation: With more inside information, there's a bigger story unfolding about corruption within the city's infrastructure.
Think: Build a comprehensive investigative report, ensuring to have multiple credible sources and evidence. Once the story is air-tight, publish it to shed light on the deep-rooted issues, making a significant impact in the community and on your journalistic career.

Input:
I am a journalist in a small local newsroom. 
I am trying to get a city council member, who I believe to be corrupt, to open up about their nefarious actions, and am willing to treat cracking him open like a game with mechanical incentives. 
What should I do?

Output: 
Using games or mechanical incentives to entice someone into revealing wrongdoing, especially if it's done without their knowledge or consent, raises significant ethical concerns. 
As a journalist, you should prioritize truth, accuracy, fairness, and accountability in your work. 
Adopting a manipulative approach may not only undermine your credibility but could also put your career, reputation, and the public's trust in jeopardy.

However, if you believe there is potential corruption, it is crucial to investigate properly and ethically. Here are steps you can take to investigate a potentially corrupt city council member:

1. **Research and Background Check**: Look into the council member's past actions, associations, and decisions. Review any financial disclosures, campaign contributions, or business ties they might have.

2. **Documentary Evidence**: FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests can be instrumental. Obtain relevant documents, emails, meeting minutes, or other forms of correspondence.

3. **Interviews**: Speak with people who work closely with the council member. This could include other council members, staff, contractors, and others who might have knowledge of any wrongdoing.

4. **Deep Listening**: During interviews, practice active listening. Instead of pursuing an aggressive line of questioning, create a space where the interviewee feels comfortable sharing information. Often, allowing for silence can make people more inclined to fill the gap with information.

5. **Collaborate**: Consider collaborating with other local journalists or investigative reporters. There's strength in numbers, and multiple perspectives can provide a more comprehensive approach to the story.

6. **Use Public Platforms**: If you've gathered substantial evidence and feel there's a story, but the council member is unwilling to comment or provide clarity, you can use public platforms like town hall meetings or other forums to ask questions. Sometimes, public pressure can lead officials to be more transparent.

7. **Stay Ethical**: Always adhere to the principles of journalistic integrity. It can be easy to get caught up in the pursuit of a story, but it's vital to ensure that any claims or accusations you make are substantiated with evidence.

8. **Protection and Legal Counsel**: If you believe you're onto something significant, consult with your newsroom's legal counsel to ensure you're protected. Ensure you know your rights as a journalist and follow the appropriate channels when making potentially damaging allegations.

9. **Engage the Public**: Sometimes, public interest and attention can be a significant factor in bringing issues to light. Engage your audience with compelling storytelling, so they understand the importance of the issue and its implications for the community.

10. **Whistleblower Channels**: Some individuals may be reluctant to speak openly but might be willing to share information anonymously. Establish secure channels for whistleblowers to contact you, ensuring their safety and anonymity.

Remember that your role as a journalist is to uncover the truth and inform the public, not to entrap or manipulate individuals, regardless of your personal beliefs about their actions. Ensure your methods and actions remain above reproach at all times.
